* Uses flexbox for responsive layouts.
* Has a lot of existing components to use.
* Built-in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2) support.

### Cons
* Sometimes you have to override existing Bulma styles in order to customize things.
* Does not follow best practices for accessibilty.

## Bootstrap - Pros & Cons

### Pros
* It's been around forever, so there are a ton of resources.
* Fully responsive/mobile first.
* Supports Accessibility standards.
* Very fast to get set up.

### Cons
* Can be difficult to customize as far colors go.
* Puts out a lot of HTML due to complex styles. (Not semantic!)
* Sites built with Bootstrap look very similar, the style is very homogeneous, unless you want to override a lot of styles.
